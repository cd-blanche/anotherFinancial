Financing made fun. 

Finances have always been a swept-to-the-side thing for me. It was never really taught back in high school and even in the brief period I attended college. I would always seem to avoid, despite always getting the usual advice on:
"Save your money" 
or
"Make sure to always pay your credit card at the end of the month"
...
Man I probably should've listened to them.

In any case, here's to a new way to teach, learn, and have fun with finances.
--- MWP still in progress ---
Financi allows you to keep track of your finances in a video game style leveling experience.

After creating an account for the first time, users are prompted to attend a brief mini course/tutorial on Financi, explaining different terms and different concepts in brief game like tutorials.

Once landed onto the main dashboard, users are prompted to explore the different cards available for them, namely - "Rewards, Goals, Income, Expenses, Savings, and Debt". Each of these cards play a significant role in both in helping keep track of a users finances and their in-app progression.

- Rewards -
Rewards is a section where you can add different items to your wishlist. These items can vary from that $200.00 gaming keyboard you've been eyeing on, or perhaps that vacation you've been planning on taking. This section will help you keep track of your rewards and will let you invest different amounts depending on how you would like to distribute your income.

- Income - 
The income section is what will allow you to keep track of your earned income, whether it be through a weekly or bi-weekly paycheck, or perhaps contractual jobs. Each paycheck is tracked and every time an expense has to be made, the income total will be made to reflect the change.

- Expense -
Every expense that is made will be listed here. 

- Savings -

- Debt -

- Goals -

- Progression -
Every time an action has been completed - ex: depositing a paycheck, paying a bill, adding to savings, investing into a reward, achieving a milestone on a goal, etc. - XP will be rewarded and added towards your progression bar. Financi utilizes a level system that allows users to earn perks and unlock different rewards and goals. This is to give a sense of progression with each and every action. This is the bread and butter of Financi as it gives users - now players - a sense of achievement with their finances.
